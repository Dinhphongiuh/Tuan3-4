                Casading style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language
                used for describing the look and formating of a Document 
                written in a markup language. Although most often used to 
                change the style of web pages and user interfaces written in
                HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any kind of XML
                document, including plain XLM, SVG and XUL. Along with HTML
                and Javascript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most
                Websites to create visually engaging webapes, user interfaces
                for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applocations.[1]

                CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content
                from document presentation, including elements such as the layout, colors,
                and fonts. [2] This separation can improve content accessibility,
                provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
                characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages to share
